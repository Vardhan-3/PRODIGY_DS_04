# 💬 Twitter Sentiment Analysis – Understanding Public Opinion

This project analyzes and visualizes **sentiment patterns in social media data**, specifically Twitter posts, to understand how people feel about certain topics, trends, or brands. The goal is to detect overall sentiment trends and gain insights into public attitudes using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Analyze Twitter data to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Understand how sentiment varies across tweets, topics, or hashtags
- Visualize sentiment trends and identify opinion spikes or shifts
- Provide actionable insights into brand or topic perception

## 📁 Dataset: Twitter Training Dataset

- **Source**: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset (Training Set)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Type**: Labeled text data with tweet content and sentiment labels
- **Sample Features**:
  - `Tweet_ID`
  - `Text`
  - `Sentiment` (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral)
  - `Hashtags` or `Topics` (if available)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data cleaning & transformation
- **NLTK / TextBlob / Scikit-learn** – NLP and sentiment classification
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / WordCloud** – Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Development platform

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis, and special characters
   - Convert text to lowercase, remove stopwords
   - Tokenization and optional lemmatization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of sentiment labels
   - Most common words and hashtags by sentiment
   - Time-based sentiment patterns (if timestamp exists)

3. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Use pre-labeled data or apply models like:
     - TextBlob for rule-based sentiment
     - Logistic Regression / SVM for supervised learning
     - Fine-tuned BERT for advanced classification (optional)

4. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts for sentiment distribution
   - Word clouds for each sentiment class
   - Pie charts for topic-specific sentiment breakdown
